## Question 2

During sleep, we expect maximum heart rate of a phase to be **lower** than the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase does sleep occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings. 

deep sleep. maximum heart rate is 70 bpm. phrase 3.

## Question 3

During exercise, we expect the maximum heart rate of a phase to be **higher** the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase(s) does exercise occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings.
